This repository accompanies the thesis "Using seismology to image subduction termination in northern Borneo" and contains the code used to compute receiver functions and other related results.

SMURFPy and PyGLImER were also used for this thesis. My adaptations to these packages are available on my profile as forked packages (pending).
